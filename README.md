# To-do-list-project

Project Overview: Your To-Do List project is a web-based application that allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks. The project utilizes HTML for structuring content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic functionality.

Features:

Delete Button: Each task list item has a delete button, enabling users to remove tasks from the list. This feature allows users to easily manage their tasks and remove any unnecessary or completed tasks.
Mark Tasks as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed, which likely changes the task's visual representation (e.g., strikethrough or color change). This feature helps users track their progress and identify completed tasks.
Local Storage: The application uses local storage to save tasks, ensuring that they persist even after the user closes the browser. This feature allows users to access their tasks across multiple sessions.
Search Bar: A search bar allows users to search for specific tasks, making it easier to find tasks within a large list. This feature is particularly useful for users with a long list of tasks.
Due Date Feature (Optional): Although not explicitly mentioned as implemented, considering adding a due date feature would enable users to set deadlines for tasks, enhancing the application's functionality.
Implementation:

HTML Structure: The HTML structure provides the foundation for the application's user interface. It consists of a container element that holds the task list items. Each task list item is represented by a list item element, containing the task text, delete button, and possibly a checkbox for marking tasks as completed.

CSS Styling: The CSS styles the application, making it visually appealing and user-friendly. It defines the layout, colors, and typography for the task list, search bar, and other elements. The CSS also handles the visual representation of completed tasks, such as strikethrough or color changes.

JavaScript Functionality: JavaScript adds interactivity to the application, handling events such as deleting tasks, marking tasks as completed, saving tasks to local storage, and retrieving tasks from local storage. JavaScript also enables the search bar functionality, filtering tasks based on the user's input.

User Experience: The application provides a user-friendly interface for users to manage their tasks. Users can add new tasks, delete tasks, mark tasks as completed, and search for specific tasks. The application's local storage feature ensures that tasks are saved even after the user closes the browser, allowing users to access their tasks across multiple sessions.
